1.Write which stack is the closest to you
Data Science, Data Analytics.  

2.Why do you want to get into IT world
Because I like math, econometrics, like to analyze, to find solutions for problems. 
I believe that I can realize my potential in DS and will not just work for money (what is important too), but also for satisfaction.

3.Which problem will you be able to solve?
Currently I am working in Finance/Investments, so maybe I would like to create some models for analyzing/creating investment strategies etc.
In the future I think it would be nice to work in different fields (not finance), where I can work with data, learn something new.
